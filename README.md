This project presents a basic yet insightful dashboard built using publicly available road accident data from the United Kingdom.

The data has been carefully cleansed and transformed to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Focusing on the years 2021â€“2022, the dashboard visualizes key aspects of road accidents, highlighting the various factors that may have contributed to these incidents.

The goal of this report is not only to analyze past accidents but also to identify critical risk indicators that could help prevent future disasters.

It aims to provide valuable insights for authorities and policymakers to proactively recognize patterns, address vulnerabilities, and take necessary preventive actions.
